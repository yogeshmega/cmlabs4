== Description ==

Whether you’re just getting started with HubSpot or already a HubSpot power user, **Contact Form Builder for WordPress and Conversion Tools by HubSpot** will let you use HubSpot tools on your WordPress website and connect the two platforms without dealing with code.

A free HubSpot account will allow you to take advantage of all the plugin features. <a href=“https://app.hubspot.com/signup/marketing?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces” target=“_blank”>Click here to create your account</a>.

The plugin includes forms and pop-ups to capture leads, a dashboard to show the emails you’ve captured and a contact database with insights on your leads.

All these features work immediately once you connect your WordPress site with your HubSpot account.

Let's take a look at how HubSpot's Contact Form Builder for WordPress can help you get more leads and email subscribers.

= Drag and Drop Form Builder =

Add contact forms and email capture pop-ups to your website in minutes using the drag and drop form builder. You can choose from three type of forms:

- Inline form: A form you can embed directly on your site pages
- Overlay modal: A pop-up that appears in the center of the screen
- Banner: An banner at the top of the page
- Slide-in box: A small box that slides in from the side of the page

= Fully Integrated Customer Relationship Management =

Your HubSpot account comes with a <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">free HubSpot CRM</a>. When someone fills out your form, their data is sent directly to your HubSpot CRM so you can easily organize and segment your contacts into lists.

The plugin automatically enriches your contact profiles with public information from across the web. You can view each contact in your HubSpot CRM to find out how they found your website and which pages they viewed.

If you’re already using a form tool on your site like Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms, or Contact Form 7, no problem. HubSpot's Conversion Tools will automatically capture those form submissions and add them to your CRM so you can keep all your contacts in one place.

= Analyze and Improve Your Conversions =

Using the built-in analytics, you will see which pages and traffic sources drive the most conversions so you can double down on what’s working and see where you can improve.

= Let Your Site Visitors Talk to You When They Want =

As a part of HubSpot's Conversion Tools, the plugin also allows you to embed a <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/live-chat?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">live chat</a> widget on your WordPress site so visitors can chat with you when they want to.

= Why aren’t my pop-ups working? =

There are three reasons your pop-up forms may not be working:

1. Your tracking code is not installed properly. Please see the instructions above, or <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/lead-flows/why-arent-my-lead-flows-displaying?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces" target="_blank">this article for troubleshooting</a>.
2. You previously cancelled, or pressed “x,” on your pop-up. Once you dismiss the pop-up we will not show it for 14-days.
3. You, or your contact, already filled out the pop-up form. Once a pop-up form is submitted, it will not display again for the same user.

= What will my visitors see if I have multiple pop-up forms active on a page? =

**If a visitor has previously dismissed a pop-up form:**
They won’t be presented with that same pop-up form for 14 days. If they previously submitted that pop-up and view a page with the same pop-up on the same browser without clearing their cookies, they will not be shown the same pop-up form again.

**If more than one pop-up is set to a single URL:**
The pop-up form set to the most specific page URL will take priority. For example, if you have a pop-up set to load on “All Pages” and a pop-up is set to load on “http://www.domain.com/home”, the pop-up form set to load on “http://www.domain.com/home” will display. This applies to pop-ups that have the same triggers (On 50% page scroll, On exit intent, etc) or the same type (pop-up box, dropdown banner, etc).

**If there are two pop-ups with different triggers set to load on the same page with the same location specificity:**
The pop-up form won’t conflict each other and will wait for their respective triggers, given that the user has not previously submitted or dismissed either pop-up form. For example, if a pop-up form is set to load on all pages and is triggered on 50% page scroll and another pop-up is set to load on all pages and is triggered on exit intent, the two pop-ups will load when the user triggers each pop-up.
